# To Do List App with Mongo

## Instructions

For the main part of this week's project, you need to take last week's project "to do list" and use Mongo for persistant data storage.

Your application's front-end will remain the same, but instead of storing to do list items in the Node application, you must use a Mongo database and Mongoose to store those to do list items. This way if the application exits, the to do list items still exist.


### You need to meet the following requirements

- The requirements from the last homework still apply
- You must use a Mongo database hosted on Heroku using the mLab add-on
- You must use the Mongoose Node module to connect with the Mongo database
- The to do list items must be stored in Mongo and can not be stored in your Node application
- Deploy the final application to Heroku (using hosted Mongo database via mLab add-on) and submit **two** links: a Heroku link and your Github repo link.
